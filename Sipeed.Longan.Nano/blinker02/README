Derived from blinker01

Uses the mtime or systick timer built into the bumblebee core.


If you slow this down like this

            if((rx&0x100000)!=0) break;

then use a stopwatch/clock of some sort its about 8 seconds
between led state changes.

16million/8 = 2 million.  And supposedly the mtime timer is sysclk/4
so that makes 8MHz.  Which is what is found in the documentation, the


Internal 8M RC oscillators (IRC8M)

The internal 8M RC oscillator, IRC8M, has a fixed frequency of 8 MHz
and is the default clock source selection for the CPU when the device
is powered up.
