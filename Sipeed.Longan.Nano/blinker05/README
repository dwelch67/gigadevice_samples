This one is derived from blinker02 and uart04.

108/8 = 13.5
108/4 = 27

The maximum frequency of the AHB, APB2 and APB1 domains is
108 MHz, 108 MHz, 54 MHz.

Sets the system to 108Mhz except for APB1 which is 54Mhz.

Like blinker04, three blinks using the default 8MHz RC clock then sets
to 108MHz.
