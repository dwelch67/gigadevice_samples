This one is derived from blinker02 and uart04.

The maximum frequency of the AHB, APB2 and APB1 domains is
108 MHz, 108 MHz, 54 MHz.

The crystal on this board is 8MHz.

54/8 = 6.75
54/4 = 13.5

It can maybe do 13.5 but I know it can multiply by 6.5 so

5 * 6.5 = 52.  So lets go with 52MHz, and we can keep all the
domains at the system clock without any divisors.  Everyone runs 52MHz
basically.

Starting with the internal 8MHz RC clock it blinks the led on/off 3 times
one second on one second off.  Then sets the clock to 52MHz and uses
the same number of ticks.  The led now blinks 6.5 times faster
demonstrating that we sped up the clock.
