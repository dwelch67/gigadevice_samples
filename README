I recently purchased a

Sipeed Longan Nano - RISC-V GD32VF103CBT6 Development Board

So the board appears to be from seeed.  The MCU from GigaDevice
and from the github page

https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Sipeed-Longan-Nano

I assume that GigaDevice got their RISC-V core from Nuclei called
a Bumblebee.

"The GD32VF103 MCU series adopts the new Bumblebee processor core based
on the open source RISC-V instruction set architecture. It is jointly
developed by GigaDevice and Chinaâ€™s leading RISC-V processor core IP
and solution manufacturer Nuclei System Technology, offering a
commercial RISC-V processor core for IoT and ultra-low power
applications."

Over time if I acquire other GigaDevice based boards I will add them
to this repository.
