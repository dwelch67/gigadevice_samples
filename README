I recently purchased a

Sipeed Longan Nano - RISC-V GD32VF103CBT6 Development Board

So the board appears to be from seeed.  The MCU from GigaDevice
and from the github page

https://github.com/SeeedDocument/Sipeed-Longan-Nano

I assume that GigaDevice got their RISC-V core from Nuclei called
a Bumblebee.

"The GD32VF103 MCU series adopts the new Bumblebee processor core based
on the open source RISC-V instruction set architecture. It is jointly
developed by GigaDevice and Chinaâ€™s leading RISC-V processor core IP
and solution manufacturer Nuclei System Technology, offering a
commercial RISC-V processor core for IoT and ultra-low power
applications."

Over time if I acquire other GigaDevice based boards I will add them
to this repository.


Eventually/quickly a UART solution will be something you want to have.
This is NOT RS232C levels this is 3.3V levels so a usb uart solution
is what you want, FTDI breakout boards are ideal, but with the
raspberry pi there are also cables with the FTDI part buried in
the connector.  Be careful with these as the rx/tx is not obvious
you dont want to connect TX to TX and possibly burn up a part,  I
prefer the FTDI breakout boards (3.3V not the 5V boards or get one
with a jumper and set it on 3.3V).  Some can be had on ebay or elsewhere
for a couple of bucks, if you are willing to gamble on ebay from
overseas, I was lucky for years but that has gone away I have not
had success in a while.  (they send an empty envelope, ebay is satisfied
because a tracking number shows delivery)

The adafruit/sparkfun links tend to be solid for years but no link
lasts forever these links may be bad at some point

This works no soldering required

This is closer to ideal as you can use it for uart or jtag or other
but this one soldering is required

The arduino ones tend to have connectors, have to be careful to get
the 3.3V ones NOT the 5V ones.

FTDI parts are expensive that is probably why the non-FTDI ones are
less expensive.  Even with some of these breakouts you can get at
more of the FTDI features as desired.  The benefit of these is that
you dont need to solder just need some jumper wires which sparkfun
and adafruit both carry (as well as ebay).

Get the right sex, the Sipeed board has male pins on the board so
one end needs to be female, many of the arduino ones the breakout
is female so you need a male/female

With the $2 ebay ones a female female is desired.

Sparkfun and others carry a larger count assorted pack.

Note that adafruit in general but many of the above products can be
had from Amazon for similar prices but without the high shipping cost
I tend to buy a number of things at the same time to spread out the
shipping cost ($4 item plus $7 shipping just hurts but 4 $4 items at
 $7 shipping hurts less)

The day I wrote this this was $14.95 at adafruit, shipping there is
usually around $7
https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264
Same board at amazon $15.88, free shipping with prime.

When buying boards like the Sipeed one I often buy two at least in part
to spread out the shipping cost, but also in case I brick one, with
decades of experience you still brick things from time to time or
let the smoke out.

It is very much worth learning to solder, learing to solder pins on
breakout boards is a good starting point.

Ideally you want to use the same computer to power the mcu board and
the uart solution, you can cheat and not need a ground, but also you
wont blow things up.

Your best bet for starting out is the raspberry pi cable, one with
the four separate female connectors, just have to be careful to
figure out which one is RX.  Assume there is no color coding standard
as each vendor of these uses different colors.

Pro tip, for setting up the dumb terminal program on your development
machine (minicom, teraterm, etc) use a paperclip or something like
that as a jumper wire between RX and TX on the host side (not using
the mcu board at all at this point).  If you cannot type something
and see it echo back, then remove the jumper and not see it echo back
then replace the jumper and see it echo back, you are not read to
connect to the mcu.

NOTE:

The TX on one side connects to the RX on the other.  If only wanting
to see uart output from the mcu then you want the mcu side TX connected
to the usb uart RX.
